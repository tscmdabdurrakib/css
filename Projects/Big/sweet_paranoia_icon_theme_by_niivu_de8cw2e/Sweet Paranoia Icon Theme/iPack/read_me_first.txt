Remove the file extension ".remove" from the file before using.

iPacks are only for builds 1809 and prior of Windows.  For 1903 and higher use the 7TSP installer.

(Some antivirus programs are sensitive to iPACKS so you may have to disable in order to download and run the program)
When running the program it will ask if you'd like to create a System Restore point.  Please do so!
To restore your default icons rerun the installer or uninstall from control panel.  Also always remove any other iPACKS prior to installation of new ones!

I'm not responsible for anyone bricking their system.
